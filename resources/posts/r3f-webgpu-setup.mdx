## 1. Why WebGPU?

**WebGPU is coming to a browser near you soon!** In fact, we're only really waiting for Safari to catch up. At which point it will become the standard for 3D graphics on the web.
I believe it's important we stay ahead of the curve, which is why I'm diving into this now, despite it's experimental status.

<Aside title='Benefits of WebGPU'>
- Web GPU offers `compute shaders` which will allow us to more easily implement complex shaders and simulations in the future.
- WebGPU allows for larger and more flexible storage buffers compared to WebGL.
- Many have found that it can outperform WebGL performance wise (although we are of course still limited by the power of the device's GPU.)

For more info see the Google article [From WebGL to WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/from-webgl-to-webgpu).

## 1. Install Dependencies
I'm using Next.js 15.2 along with the latest version of React Three Fiber (v9).

```bash
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

## 2. Setup the Canvas Component

At the time of writing (March 2025) we need to `extend` the `three/webgpu` module to get it to work correctly with React Three Fiber.

You can check out the R3F documentation here: [WebGPU](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/tutorials/v9-migration-guide#webgpu)

We'll use the `WebGPU` capabilities utility to check if the browser supports the new WebGPU renderer. 
If it's not supported, we'll fallback to the WebGLRenderer.

_Note that the `gl` function is async to support the WebGPU initialization._


```tsx {9-12, 15, 28-35} showLineNumbers
"use client";
import { OrbitControls, Stats } from "@react-three/drei";
import { Canvas, extend, type ThreeToJSXElements } from "@react-three/fiber";
import React, { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import WebGPU from "three/examples/jsm/capabilities/WebGPU.js";
import { type WebGPURendererParameters } from "three/src/renderers/webgpu/WebGPURenderer.js";
import * as THREE from "three/webgpu";

declare module "@react-three/fiber" {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type
  interface ThreeElements extends ThreeToJSXElements<typeof THREE> {}
}

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
extend(THREE as any);

type Props = PropsWithChildren<{
  isMobile?: boolean;
}>;

const WebGPUCanvas: FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  if (!WebGPU.isAvailable()) return null;
  return (
    <Canvas
      className="!fixed inset-0"
      performance={{ min: 0.5, debounce: 300 }}
      camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], far: 20 }}
      gl={async (props) => {
        console.warn("WebGPU is supported");
        const renderer = new THREE.WebGPURenderer(
          props as WebGPURendererParameters
        );
        await renderer.init();
        return renderer;
      }}
    >
      {/* Your components here */}
      {children}
      <OrbitControls />
      {process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && <Stats />}
    </Canvas>
  );
};

export default WebGPUCanvas;
```

## 3. WebGPU shader code using TSL/Node Material

Three have been busy working on [Three Shading Language (TSL)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language) and Node materials - which enable us to easily extend default materials with custom shader logic... all inside our JavaScript/TypeScript!
If you've extended a shader before, you'll know it's a fairly clunky process to inject GLSL code into another GLSL shader string at the right position.

<Aside>
This is where TSL shines:
- It removes the complexity of extending existing shaders
- GLSL code won't run on WebGPU, but TSL is renderer agnostic - meaning it's output is compatible with both WebGL and WebGPU. 
- It makes it easier to offload computations to the GPU for better performance
- It's easier for JS developers to understand and work with
</Aside>

In the following code, you'll see how we are able to utilise the base capabilities of the `meshPhongNodeMaterial` (lighting, shadows, etc) whilst overriding the color node with custom gradients.

You'll also notice that the position transformation is done in the vertex shader, when we subtract a vec3(x,y,z) to the original world position of the sphere.

What is trivial here was previously quite tedious with GLSL shader materials.

```tsx title="InteractiveSphere.tsx" showLineNumbers
"use client";
import { Sphere } from "@react-three/drei";
import { useFrame } from "@react-three/fiber";
import React, { type FC, useMemo, useState } from "react";
import { MathUtils } from "three";
import { color, mix, uv, positionWorld, uniform, vec3 } from "three/tsl";

// Basic component showing how to add smooth hover interactivity with TSL

export const InteractiveSphere: FC = () => {
  const [isPointerOver, setIsPointerOver] = useState(false);

  const { key, colorNode, positionNode, uHovered } = useMemo(() => {
    // Define a uniform for the hover value
    const uHovered = uniform(0.0);

    // Create color gradients on the Y axis (bottom to top of the sphere)
    const defaultColor = mix(color("#3F4A4B"), color("#1A2526"), uv().y);
    const hoverColor = mix(color("#14DCE9"), color("#B462D1"), uv().y);

    // Mix between two default and hovered colors based on the hover value
    const colorNode = mix(defaultColor, hoverColor, uHovered);

    // Translate the sphere along the Z axis based on the hover value (0 - 1)
    const positionNode = positionWorld.sub(vec3(0, 0, uHovered));

    // Generate a key for the material so that it updates when this data changes
    // (it won't in this scenario because useMemo has no dependencies)
    const key = colorNode.uuid;
    return { key, colorNode, positionNode, uHovered };
  }, []);

  // When hovered, smoothly transition to 1.0, otherwise back to 0.0
  useFrame((_, delta) => {
    uHovered.value = MathUtils.damp(
      uHovered.value,
      isPointerOver ? 1.0 : 0.0,
      5,
      delta
    );
  });

  return (
    <Sphere
      position={[0, 0, 0]}
      args={[1, 40, 40]}
      onPointerEnter={() => {
        document.body.style.cursor = "pointer";
        setIsPointerOver(true);
      }}
      onPointerLeave={() => {
        document.body.style.cursor = "auto";
        setIsPointerOver(false);
      }}
    >
      {/* We're using the Phong Node material for built-in lighting/shadows/shininess */}
      <meshPhongNodeMaterial
        key={key}
        colorNode={colorNode}
        positionNode={positionNode}
        shininess={20}
      />
    </Sphere>
  );
};

```

### Code Breakdown
- The code within the `useMemo` runs once and generates the shader code for the material
- We're importing shader values/functions from `three/tsl`
- We're applying a custom `colorNode` which smoothly transitions between two gradients based on the hovered value 
- We're applying a `positionNode` that translates the sphere along the Z axis based on the hover value
- The `uHovered` uniform is smoothly updated inside useFrame based on whether the pointer is over the sphere

## Summary

There isn't a great deal of documentation on the subject of TSL, especially inside R3F. 
I plan to help contribute to the community by sharing examples and tutorials as I learn more about this promising new approach to 3D web development.
