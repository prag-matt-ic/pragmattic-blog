## Some Motivation 

This type of scroll controlled image sequence can be found on world class sites such as Apple's [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/) landing page. I've personally implemented something similar on a global project for a leading retail brand.

In this guide I'll explain how to build this scrolling image sequence in Next.js (Typescript) with GSAP... and hopefully help you take your web experiences to the next level üöÄ

<Aside title="Pros and cons of image sequences">
**Pros:**
- High fidelity visuals with pre-baked lighting and shadows not possible in real-time
- Runs well on lower powered devices
- Relatively easy to implement

**Cons:**
- Lower frame rates than a realtime 3D model or video
- Large set of images required for a smooth animation which can be heavy to load
- Limited interactivity (forwards/backwards motion) compared to 3D models which can have pointer interactions
</Aside>

## Install Dependencies
To get started, ensure your Next.js project is setup with Tailwind CSS. If you're starting from scratch, run the Next.js install command and enter Y to all the options.

```bash
npx create-next-app scroll-driven-image-sequence
```

Then install the following packages:

```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react @mantine/hooks
```

[GSAP](https://gsap.com/): For advanced animations<br/>
[@gsap/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gsap/react): useGSAP is a replacement for useEffect() that automatically handles cleanup<br/>
[@mantine/hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mantine/hooks): Useful set of UI hooks - we'll be using viewport size detection and value debouncing


## Prepare Your Image Sequence Frames

<Image src='/blog/images/image-sequence-files.png' alt='Image sequence files' width={1200} height={800} quality={80} className='object-contain' />

You'll need a series of sequentially named image files (e.g., `img0001.png`, `img0002.png`).
If you're working with a 3D designer they'll be able to render these for you.

If you want, you can [download my images from here](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/pragmattic/tree/main/public/images/bottle).
Shoutout to [Derek Elliott](https://www.derrk.com/) for his awesome 3D work on these üçæ

Once ready, stick them in a `public/images` directory to be loaded later.

*Ideally you'd also have a variety of sizes for different screen sizes, but for this project we'll just sitck to one size for simplicity.*

## Component Overview and Markup

In this example we'll be building a header component designed for the top of the page.<br/> 
The header will be pinned (fixed) until the user scrolls a certain distance and the image sequence has finished.<br/> 
The images will be rendered one by one into a canvas, with the current scroll position determining which frame to draw.

Here's the initial component structure:

```tsx {1, 8, 15-20}  title="ImageSequenceHeader.tsx" showLineNumbers
'use client'
import { useGSAP } from '@gsap/react'
import { useDebouncedValue, useDidUpdate, useViewportSize } from '@mantine/hooks'
import gsap from 'gsap'
import ScrollTrigger from 'gsap/dist/ScrollTrigger'
import React, { type FC, useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, useGSAP)

const ImageSequenceHeader: FC = () => {
  const header = useRef<HTMLElement>(null)
  const canvas = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null)

  return (
      <header ref={header} className="relative h-[200lvh] w-full select-none overflow-hidden">
        <div id="content-wrapper" className="relative z-20 flex h-lvh w-full items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tighter text-white md:text-[8.5vmax]">Animate Responsibly</h1>
          <canvas ref={canvas} className="pointer-events-none absolute scale-75 bg-transparent" />
        </div>
      </header>
      // Remember to ensure your page can scroll by setting a min-h on it! 
  )
}
```

### Breakdown
- We've marked the component as `client` side rendered so we can use refs and GSAP
- We've remembered to register the relevant GSAP plugins
- The header height is 200% of the (large) viewport height. 2 screen heights is the amount the user will scroll to complete the sequence.
- The content wrapper (stuff that will be pinned) is full screen size
- The canvas is positioned absolutely above the heading
- Both the heading and canvas are centered by their parent using flex


## Loading images and updating the canvas

When the component mounts we'll load all the images and draw the first frame onto the canvas.
We generate an array of image sources based on the file naming pattern. In this case we have 60 frames.

```tsx title="ImageSequenceHeader.tsx"
  // Inside our component
 const viewportSize = useViewportSize()
 const [loadedImages, setLoadedImages] = useState<HTMLImageElement[]>()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!canvas.current) return
    if (viewportSize.width === 0 || viewportSize.height === 0) return // First render value is 0
    if (!!loadedImages) return

    const intialSetup = async () => {
      // Image Dimensions: 1920 / 1080
      const imageAspect = 1920 / 1080
      const imageWidth = viewportSize.width
      const imageHeight = viewportSize.width / imageAspect
      canvas.current!.width = viewportSize.width
      canvas.current!.height = viewportSize.height

      const imageSrcs: string[] = Array.from(
        { length: 60 },
        (_, i) => `/images/bottle/pragma100${i + 1 < 10 ? `0${i + 1}` : i + 1}.png`,
      )

      // We will cover this function in the next section...
      const images = await loadImagesAndDrawFirstFrame({
        canvas: canvas.current!,
        imageSrcs: imageSrcs,
        imageWidth: imageWidth,
        imageHeight: imageHeight,
      })

      setLoadedImages(images)
    }

    intialSetup()
  }, [viewportSize, loadedImages])

```

### Summary
- We're using the `useViewportSize` Mantine hook to get the current viewport size
- Once we have the viewport size we calculate the image dimensions based on a 1920x1080 aspect ratio (or whatever aspect the images are)
- `imageSrcs` is an array generated from the file naming pattern, pointing to our assets in the public folder
- We call `loadImagesAndDrawFirstFrame` and then set the loaded images into state *(detailed below)*
- We don't run this effect again once the images are loaded

### Load images and draw the first frame

This helper function will download all of the images, and immediately render the first one into the canvas.<br/> 
It returns a promise of image elements which we're setting into the component's state above.

```ts title="loadImagesAndDrawFirstFrame" showLineNumbers
const loadImagesAndDrawFirstFrame = async ({
  canvas,
  imageSrcs,
  imageWidth,
  imageHeight,
}: {
  canvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  imageSrcs: string[]
  imageWidth: number
  imageHeight: number
}): Promise<HTMLImageElement[]> => {
  let images: HTMLImageElement[] = []
  let loadedCount = 0

  return new Promise<HTMLImageElement[]>(async (resolve, reject) => {
    const onImageLoad = (index: number, img: HTMLImageElement) => {
      // Draw the first frame ASAP
      if (index === 0) {
        const context = canvas.getContext('2d', { alpha: true })
        if (!context) return
        updateCanvasImage(context, canvas, img)
      }
      loadedCount++
      const hasLoadedAll = loadedCount === imageSrcs.length - 1
      if (hasLoadedAll) resolve(images)
    }

    const retries: { [imgIndex: number]: number } = {}
    const maxRetries = 3

    const onImageError = (i: number, img: HTMLImageElement) => {
      // Try reloading this image a couple of times. If it fails then reject.
      if (retries[i] < maxRetries) {
        console.warn(`Image ${i} failed to load. Retrying... ${retries[i]}`)
        img.src = `${imageSrcs[i]}?r=${retries[i]}`
        retries[i]++
      } else {
        reject()
      }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < imageSrcs.length - 1; i++) {
      const img = new Image()
      img.src = imageSrcs[i]
      // Math.min for contain, Math.max for cover
      const scale = Math.max(canvas!.width / imageWidth, canvas!.height / imageHeight)
      img.width = imageWidth * scale
      img.height = imageHeight * scale
      img.addEventListener('load', (e: any) => onImageLoad(i, img))
      img.addEventListener('error', (e) => onImageError(i, img))
      images.push(img)
    }
  })
}

const updateCanvasImage = (
  renderingContext: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  canvas: HTMLCanvasElement,
  image: HTMLImageElement,
) => {
  if (!renderingContext || !canvas || !image) throw new Error('Unable to update canvas')
  // If you need to center the image in the canvas:
  const offsetX = canvas.width / 2 - image.width / 2
  const offsetY = canvas.height / 2 - image.height / 2
  renderingContext.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)
  renderingContext.drawImage(image, offsetX, offsetY, image.width, image.height)
}
```

### `loadImagesAndDrawFirstFrame`
- We're looping through all the image sources and creating a HTML Image element for each
- We attach a load event listener to each image which will call `onImageLoad` when the image is ready
- ...or `onImageError` if the image fails to load
- If an image fails to load, we retry up to 3 times before rejecting the promise
- When the image loads, if it's the first index we draw it onto the canvas
- Once all of the images have loaded, we resolve the promise with the array of images

### `updateCanvasImage`
- This function is responsible for drawing an image onto the canvas
- It's important to first clear the entire canvas, because the images are transparent and would otherwise be drawn on top of each other.


## Update the canvas on scroll

We'll implement the `useGSAP` hook and create a `ScrollTrigger` to update the canvas image based on the scroll progress:

```tsx title="ImageSequenceHeader.tsx"
  useGSAP(
    () => {
      if (!canvas.current || !loadedImages) return
      const context = canvas.current.getContext('2d', { alpha: true })
      if (!context) return

      // ScrollTrigger for updating image sequence frames
      ScrollTrigger.create({
        id: 'image-sequence',
        trigger: header.current, // Use the header as the trigger element
        start: 0, // Start at 0 scroll (top of the page)
        end: 'bottom top', // End when the bottom of the header reaches the top of the viewport (2 screen heights)
        pin: '#content-wrapper', // Pin the content (h1, canvas) so it doesn't scroll off the screen
        onUpdate: ({ progress }) => {
          // Progress ranges from 0 to 1
          // Determine the next image to draw
          const nextFrame = Math.floor(progress * loadedImages.length)
          const nextImage = loadedImages[nextFrame]
          if (!nextImage) return
          // Note: we could track the current frame in a ref, and only update when it's changed
          updateCanvasImage(context, canvas.current!, nextImage)
        },
      })
    },
    {
      dependencies: [loadedImages],
      scope: header, // Scope any query selectors to the header
    },
  )
```

**Now you should have a working image sequence that responds to the user's scroll!**

## Handling Viewport Resizes

To ensure the header canvas is responsive, we'll update it's size and redraw the current frame after a viewport resize.<br/>
We'll use the `useDebouncedValue` Mantine hook to prevent this from firing too often.<br/>
We'll use `useDidUpdate` so that the function doesn't run on the first render like a regular useEffect would. 

```tsx title="ImageSequenceHeader.tsx"
  // Additional component logic for handling viewport resize
  const [debouncedViewportSize] = useDebouncedValue(viewportSize, 500)

  useDidUpdate(() => {
    const handleViewportResize = () => {
      if (!debouncedViewportSize.width || !debouncedViewportSize.height || !loadedImages) return
      if (!canvas.current) return
      if (canvas.current.width === debouncedViewportSize.width) return
      canvas.current.width = debouncedViewportSize.width
      canvas.current.height = debouncedViewportSize.height
      const context = canvas.current.getContext('2d', { alpha: true })
      if (!context) return
      const progress = ScrollTrigger.getById('image-sequence')?.progress ?? 0
      const nextFrame = Math.floor(progress * loadedImages.length)
      const nextImage = loadedImages[nextFrame]
      if (!nextImage) return
      updateCanvasImage(context, canvas.current, nextImage)
    }
    handleViewportResize()
  }, [debouncedViewportSize])
```

### Summary 
- We pass the viewport size into `useDebouncedValue` to get a value which updates every 500ms at most
- We use the `useDidUpdate` Mantine hook to call `handleViewportResize` when the debouncedViewportSize value changes
- We make some checks to ensure the resize logic should run before setting the new canvas width and height
- We access the ScrollTrigger's progress value using it's ID, and then draw what the current frame should be using the newly sized canvas

**With this in place you now have a responsive canvas that re-draws the current frame after resizing has ended!**
