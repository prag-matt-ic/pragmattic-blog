## Creating a Particles Simulation with React Three Fiber and FBO

In this post, we'll build a dynamic particles simulation in React using React Three Fiber, enhanced with an FBO (Frame Buffer Object) scene for off-screen rendering. Weâ€™ll cover everything from setting up your project and dependencies to diving deep into the simulation and particle shaders.


## 1. Introduction
Modern web animations often rely on WebGL and shader programming for smooth and visually compelling effects. 
In our project, we use React Three Fiber to integrate Three.js with React. 
By leveraging an FBO scene, we can simulate particles off-screen and then render the final image efficiently. 
This guide walks through our setup and explains key parts of the code.

## 2. Setting Up Your Environment
Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

React Three Fiber: The React renderer for Three.js.
@react-three/drei: A helper library that provides useful abstractions, including the shaderMaterial and useFBO hooks.
GSAP: For smooth animations.
Three.js: Core library for 3D rendering.
Install these packages via npm or yarn:

{/* TODO: check the packages.. */}
```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei gsap
```
