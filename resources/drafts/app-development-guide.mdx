## Introduction 

We love building great products. It has been our passion, our existence for the last 8 years.   
As designers and developers we work closely together to bring ideas to life and support the growth of our partners' businesses.

## The Guide

This guide is geared towards those wishing to launch successful apps. That does not make it exclusive to app developers, on the contrary, it has been designed as a helpful walk-through for anyone with a vested interest in an app's development and subsequent launch.

As we progress into an increasingly digitised age, the knowledge and implementation of innovative technologies has shifted from being a novelty to a requirement. This guide provides business leaders with the expertise needed to streamline existing processes into leaner, more efficient models. Or perhaps your business is not yet at that level. Startup founders and visionaries look no further! By reading on, (and taking plenty of notes of course) you will discover how to turn your unique skills and insights into a profitable enterprise.

> "The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.” - Otto Von Bismarck

Although we here at Loopspeed would love to categorise ourselves in the same class as Otto's 'wise man', alas at the beginning, it was not so. With years experience designing and building mobile and web applications we have learned a lot. This guide will not only equip you with an advantage over your competitors, it will also ensure you steer clear of common (and not so common) pitfalls. Whether you're a first-time entrepreneur or run a thriving business, mistakes can and will happen to anyone who is either unprepared or lacks foresight. 

However, it's not all doom and gloom. In this guide you will learn tried and tested processes for all stages of development, from the initial lightbulb moment in someone's head, to launch and beyond. We believe that if something is worth doing, it's worth doing right. Which is why inter-spread throughout this entire guide are best practices to ensure your product is delivered promptly and to a high standard. You now have the chance to learn from the mistakes of those who came before you, and start (or indeed even pick up) your journey in the mindset of the wise man.

To a brighter future,  
Matthew, Ana-Maria, and the Loopspeed Team

## 1. On Your Marks
   
Before delving into the weird and wonderful world of app development, it is necessary to consider and reflect upon some important preliminary questions.  

Firstly, it is vital that you know, live and breathe your 'why'. In Simon Sinek's 'Start with Why', the entrenchment and application of a company's 'why' is of paramount importance to that company's success. Sinek argued that a loyal customer base was created not from its product, but from the reason or 'why' that product was created in the first place;
   
<Quote author="Simon Sinek">People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.</Quote>
 
So if your 'why' is to decrease the state of loneliness felt by older people in the community, it is essential that this is reflected in everything you do. Your passion for connecting vulnerable people should shine through your actions and speech, being instantly recognisable to your customers and colleagues. In this situation, potential partners and customers who believe in your 'why' will be drawn to you and give you their loyalty. However, if your 'why' is fuzzy or vague, this will be equally obvious. Even if you have the best business plan, the most promising data, and are the most persuasive speaker, people will still perceive the idea to be groundless in some way and they will instinctively dissipate.  
   
<Quote>All roads lead to Rome</Quote>
   
Ok, so you know your 'why' and you can articulate it pretty well. With this in mind, we turn to our second preliminary question; Are you certain launching an app is the right route to take in order to accomplish your goal and satisfy your 'why'? For example, would you be able to decrease loneliness among the older generation by setting up local coffee mornings in the community centre instead? Would this be a simpler and more effective method?

Don't mistake us, we love helping to imagine, design and develop apps. But we also understand that time is precious. Ask yourself some difficult questions, and answer honestly. If there is another way of achieving your goal which is better, go for it!   
Still with us? Then let's move on to the last, but no means least, of our questions. How strong is your resolve? App development is a rollercoaster. Some people love roller-coasters, others, not so much. It is important to really do some soul-searching and find out where you stand. This is because along the way there will inevitably be some ups and downs, (and possibly even those stomach-churning loop-de-loops!). Understanding how much effort and stoicism will be required to persevere is great, but knowing if you are personally capable of delivering is gold. Is this project truly worth your blood, sweat, and tears? If not, great, you're now free to pursue something better, well done for your honesty. If it is, however, read on, keep your hands and feet inside the carriage, and buckle your seatbelt. This is going to be fun.


### Chapter 1 Key Takeaways

- Get clear on why you are doing this - What's your purpose?  
- Do you really need an app or are there alternative routes to the same goal?  
- Be prepared for setbacks and obstacles

## 2. Failing to Prepare is Preparing to Fail 

<Quote author="T.S. Eliot">Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal</Quote>

More often than not, the success of products is not due to their being completely novel, instead it is the exploiting of existing technologies, in a different way. For example, the widespread use of Apple Pay is not due to its being an innovative substitution for commerce. It is simply the combination of contactless payments and fingerprint recognition, neither of which were invented nor propagated by Apple.  
A similar and equally popular strategy is the introduction of existing technology into new industries or demographics. Halal meal-prep for bodybuilders for example. 

It isn't even necessary to go as far as thinking of novel combinations. There were other social networking platforms before Facebook (a case in point for anyone who remembers their cringe-worthy Bebo or Myspace account!). However it was Facebook that took the lead in this domain after re-conceptualising and improving its design, audience and application. Sometimes all you really need is a great team and somebody else's good idea.

>Don't reinvent the wheel

Although it might be tempting to think the sole domain of success lies in novelty, it is often the case that if there is a problem, there is usually already a solution. At the very least one could be pieced together using existing applications.   
If it's the latter, it's worth discussing and researching with your team ways in which these existing apps can be leveraged. This might be by combining compatible software or testing an idea in a cost-effective way.   
In the world today 'specialisation' appears to be the buzzword in vogue. People don't want to follow a generalised diet plan, they wish to have intolerance tests, nutrition advice, and a subsequent tailored food plan. The same can be said for healthcare, where there is a distinct shift from paternalistic medicine focused on groups to a much more personalised and patient-centred system of care. In this landscape then, if you're looking to build something new, it needs to be specialised. If it is not and your audience is general, a good solution will probably exist already.

### Your vision for a better future

You have an opportunity to exploit or a problem to solve, but do you fully understand this problem and are you able to take full ownership of its solution?

Your original bright spark may have been illuminated as a result of encountering the same problem over and over again. Or you may be conscious of a certain demographic's frustration over the way things are currently done. 

This awareness, however, will only get you so far. Continuing your journey from here requires a complementary strategy for how to solve this problem. Although listening to your target audience may have revealed the initial opportunity, from here you can hit the mute button (or at least turn the volume down). Admittedly it sounds counter-intuitive to disregard their opinions, but this is only on the face of things. If you stopped to consider the clothes you wear, the house you live in, the books you read, the TV series you binge on, even the computer you are reading this on; none of these things were designed with your opinion or suggestions. Does that make them any less appealing to you? Would you have been able to do better? Unless you are simultaneously a fashion designer, architect, author, script writer, director, and computer scientist, (which would make you an exceptional human being to say the least) you would play no part in the creation of these things, you leave that to the experts.

<Aside>
In the summer of 2020 we started working with Chris, a location manager in the film industry. One of his responsibilities was to hire Marshals to help on set. Over time he'd grown increasingly frustrated with how this process was carried out. There was no time-effective way to do it, it involved phone-calling, group messaging and word of mouth. He started to imagine how technology could be exploited to make their lives easier, freeing them up time to focus on important tasks - like helping produce a great film! Chris approached Loopspeed and we worked closely with him to refine the idea. Chris was perfectly positioned to solve a genuine problem because he had a deep understanding of the difficulties that they face, and was aware of how he could simplify things using an app. We'll pick up this story later.

<Quote author="Ana-Maria">If you're qualified to make an informed decision, make it. There's no need to rely on the infinite wisdom of armchair critics.</Quote>

Whilst your aim is to improve your audience's lives, they should not design the solution for you. Business opportunities may be investigated via focus groups and surveys, but the purpose of those activities is to understand their current behaviour and pain points. Once understood, it is up to you to come up with a better way of doing things. 

Test your solution on your customers, but steer clear of 'design by committee' This will help to avoid a confusing product with an endless list of features.   
Netflix is one of the world's most popular streaming services, but they didn't start out that way. They began their journey as a DVD rental service. The key difference between Netflix and Blockbusters, however, was that the product was posted to your home rather than you physically picking it up. Customers could take advantage of no longer having to leave their house to rent a movie, but there was still space to drastically improve this ease of accessibility. 

The idea to introduce a subscription-based online streaming platform was not one that came from the customers. If Netflix had asked customers what they had wanted, they would have said faster DVD deliveries or multiple movies on one disc! It was the vision of the leaders inside the company who understood Moore's Law and the exponential acceleration of internet speed in the coming years. They envisioned on-demand entertainment and knew it would be technically viable. The streaming platform was offered to those who saw the benefits of having instant access to a substantial collection of media… and the rest is history.

Let's say you had an idea for a restaurant booking app that allows users to choose their seating and make contactless orders. If feature requirements were sourced from potential customers, you'd quickly end up with a long list of extravagant and conflicting ideas: “The one-click pint button”, Vs “Features to prevent unintentional orders and payments'';  “Restaurant capacity alerts'' Vs “ Less push notifications'' etc.. The task of understanding and prioritising all the different ideas alone will cause an unnecessary delay. Moreover, by endeavouring to incorporate all of these suggestions you run the risk of distorting your original vision. If you were to take into account every customer's preference when making sandwiches, you'd end up with the suspect and slightly menacing combination of jam, cheese, and fish paste. It's true what they say - too many chefs spoil the broth…...or sandwich. 

<Aside title="Practical tips for discussing your idea">
- Talk about their life (not your idea) in order to understand their current habits and ways of working  
- Ask specifics about the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.  
- Talk less and listen more.  
- Seek facts and commitments, not compliments.  
- Look to understand the motivations behind any requests - why do they want it?
</Aside>

Were Netflix to have given this idea to their existing client-base (one who may predominantly be more comfortable using DVD players rather than laptops), feedback would have been mixed at best. The task of sifting through and understanding all the varied views of this potential change alone would have caused an unnecessary delay (a delay which might have given competitors the advantage/be the difference between success and failure). If you're qualified to make an informed decision, make it, there's no need to rely on the infinite wisdom of armchair critics. What's the take-home? Stay away from design by committee!

You may be questioning this analogy, quietly musing that media production and app development are two very different animals. The former runs on established formulae that have proven track-records for success, whilst the latter is much more dependent on understanding exactly what the customer wants. Regrettably, this is an assumption we've seen impede many promising apps. The constant and conflicting suggestions, and advice serve only to confuse and distort the original vision. It's true what they say - too many chefs spoil the broth.

### Simple is sublime

<Quote author="Russian proverb">If you chase two rabbits, you will catch neither</Quote>


We love, respect and encourage creativity here at Loopspeed, but if we have learnt one thing working with and learning from great product leaders, it would be that simple is sublime. It is extremely common for visionaries to have many ideas all bustling for attention within their vision for an app. Often they believe that if even one of the dozen or so of their ideas is not cemented as a feature from the first release, it will spell disaster. Ironically, however, it tends to be the other way around. At the onset of a project, these numerous elements function only to weigh down the product team and dilute the core offering.

For starters coding is time consuming, and as we all know, time is money. Having more features than required will inevitably cost more. To safeguard your team against drowning in the features-pool, be wary of scope creep - an insidious drift towards adding more and more “must-have” requirements. How certain are you that all of the features on your list are truly essential? Would it be more prudent to take an iterative approach, focusing instead on doing a few things extremely well?  
Even if you are blessed with angel investors (no pun intended) or a large project budget, and have the monetary resources to order an app with everything on it, do you have an equal amount of time to spend?  
You should consider whether delaying a launch whilst you work on perfecting your app, would run the risk of having someone else launch a similar product or service first. 

{/* TODO: example */}

Let's imagine that providence is on your side. You have plenty of cash to burn and limitless time to burn it in. What could happen if you launched an app that had everything you could possibly think of as a feature embedded within the design from day one? All these features could, in fact, be all of the wrong features, and only after release, when it was given to testers and consumers, was this critical insight gained. There will unequivocally be alterations and updates that need to be made in order for it to remain a viable product. At this early stage, speed is your competitive advantage, and the larger your app, the slower it can move. A complex code-base is much harder to  change. And the need for speedy modifications and adjustments is the name of the game for new products. An overloaded app will encumber any necessary pivots needed in order to keep sailing.

<Quote author="Matthew Frawley">You can't build a Ferrari on a Nissan budget - and it's foolish to try</Quote>

We've worked with teams who have outsourced their development to low-cost offshore workshops in order to get “more” for their money. Due to the “budget” price they were charged, these teams had been able to request apps abundant in features. Search, filtering, favourites, follows - it's all there! It was only upon launching that they learned the hard truths. The UX (user experience) was not good enough and most of the features were not used, meaning they were not needed. In this scenario the only option would be to drop the deadwood (almost everything previously considered essential) and return to the drawing board, after having wasted a year or more of time and resources. You have been warned!  
   
Hopefully now you can see how important it is to be strict about what makes it into your first release. Save all the bells and whistles for later down the line when they are needed and can be justified. 

### To Assume Makes an Ass out of You
   
You've done some real soul-searching and you understand and can clearly communicate your 'why'. You've listened to or observed your target audience and seen a specific need for a product or service. You've even compiled an impressive slide deck for how you are going to solve this perceived problem through the creation of a new app. If you have made it this far you should give yourself and your team a pat on the back, you've laid the groundwork for some solid foundations. Unfortunately, kicking-back and taking it easy won't be an option just yet as there will still be a number of assumptions ingrained in your product vision that first need to be identified. You or your team should create a list titled 'Assumptions' and write down as many as you can think of. Use this exercise to try and illuminate the key assumptions you are holding in relation to your product and its success.

Introspection is always hard, but it is never wasted. Here are a few examples to help you get started.

Behaviours - Once you have launched your app, are you taking for granted that people will behave in a certain way? Is it taken for granted that users will enable notifications, write good reviews (or indeed any reviews), and invite friends to the platform? What about the impact of the problem you are trying to resolve; have you assumed it is big enough for users to adopt the solution you're offering?

Feasibility - What assumptions about the feasibility of building your product are you making? Are you assuming it will be an 'easy build'? That you will find the right people for the right tasks with the right experience and availability? That such a product can even be built at all with the current technology and budget available?  
   
Accessibility - What aspects about the accessibility of your app are you assuming? Have you used language or a tone that you assume your audience will understand and resonate with? What prior knowledge or experience is required to use your service? Have you assumed people using your app will have this awareness and comprehension?  
   
Once you have come up with a number of key (or 'leap of faith') assumptions that need to be true in order for the app to succeed, it will become obvious which features are the most important to build first. In doing so, you can test those big assumptions early on. For example, if user referral  is essential to the product's survival, a feature that enables personal invites  should be prioritised over others  that focus on personalisation. 

### Build, Test, Learn, Evolve

Had enough of theory? Then let's move on to the practical side of things, planning the production. One major assumption that may not have made it onto your list (and we trust you've made or will make one) is that there needs to be a single momentous product launch - one launch to rule all launches. One that will be the beginning of your product's continuous rise in popularity and success. Scrap that. If you have an elementary model, then launch it, 'do it, do it now'. Although you may think that your app is still in its infancy, it is a mistake to view this as a hindrance to launching.

**Follow Loopspeed's golden rule; Launch early and launch often.** 

We understand your reservations about sharing an early model. Since school we've been habituated to only exhibit the finished and highly polished results of hours of work behind the scenes. From an essay you'd been writing and redrafting for weeks, the play you'd been rehearsing so much you knew the lines in your sleep, to the office report which was the culprit of many late evenings. Indeed in most aspects of life, it is only until we are ready to present our best work that we will tolerate even a glimpse from the outside world. Software development is very different, in fact you could say it's the polar opposite. Releasing unfinished, basic models of your app as soon as you can, is exactly what you need to be doing if you are to test your assumptions early. With the users' feedback in hand you will be able to adjust, improve, define, and maybe even pivot your product in a speedy and cost-efficient manner, no assumption-fishing required. 

<Quote>If you aren't ashamed of your first release you've launched too late</Quote>

One way to ensure a miserable life is to always compare yourself to others. The same holds true for app development. When releasing the early versions of your product, it would be unproductive and demoralising to hold it up to the standards of a product that has been around for longer. You wouldn't judge an acorn to an oak tree, so don't compare your version 1 to someone else's version 10. 

Hopefully having brought you around to our way of thinking, the next question to ask yourself is what is the fastest, cheapest and simplest action that can be taken in order to start learning from users? Is it even necessary to create a working app, or would an interactive prototype serve just as well? Even a landing page whose purpose is to capture sign-ups, validating your proposition, could be employed to generate investor interest and funding with just as much efficacy as a working app. Rationing your resources and time early will be invaluable, and will ease any potential pressures as your project progresses. 

As the product is (and should be) constantly evolving, fixing a project cost is perhaps one of the more difficult aspects of app development. Product managers and investors will more often than not want to know *exactly* how much something will cost and how long it will take. It is important to understand that fixing a price on an innovative product is like fixing goalposts to a playground round-about, the goal is always moving, therefore so should your approach. 

When building something that nobody else has before, it's very difficult to know exactly how long it will take because it is impossible to discern from day one what exactly will be needed. If the project takes longer than quoted, the developer loses out and starts cutting corners, delivering sub-par work to get it finished. If, on the other hand, it turns out to be easier than expected, product owners have sunk unnecessary funds into development that could have been put to good use elsewhere. Instead both sides need to be agile and reactive to ensure both time and money is spent wisely.

<Quote author="The Agile Manifesto">Responding to change over following a plan</Quote>

Flexibility and adaptability should be the banners under which your team marches. Although sunken costs after a big investment make it harder to leave behind something that isn't working, it is crucial you adopt a mindset that will allow you to walk away when required, rather than rigid plans about budget and outcomes.  
As such, we encourage you to adopt a useful concept used here at Loopspeed, 'runway'. In more colloquial terms this is how long your company is able to fund the product development before it runs out of money, assuming expenditure and income stays constant. How many months can you iterate for? Knowing your runway and being open and adaptive to user feedback, will enable you to decide what processes and features are absolutely necessary in each release, and which can be simplified or even dropped for now. As well as development, marketing etc, your runway should factor in multiple releases and iterations. 

We understand that not everyone is in the same boat when it comes to funding and that some may be fortunate to be sailing in a yacht as opposed to the rubber dinghy that most start-up founders have to make use of. This advice still holds no matter what your nautical mode of transport. We have seen well-funded teams burn through tens of thousands of pounds building infrastructure, developing deployment and automated integration test setups before they even had a working application. Pouring large amounts of funds into these endeavours before having absolute conviction that what you are building works (and is wanted) is foolhardy to say the least. It can be the difference between success and failure, irrespective of your financial position. Mistakes like these can be avoided, however, by ensuring your development is kept 'local' - that is, it is tested on a small group of users that help to shape the product with you by offering useful insights - until it is ready for adoption by a wider audience. Did Facebook launch to the entire world on day one? No, it started off with a user base of just one University. Having feedback from the students on this single campus allowed it to be refined for its integration to the next, and the next, and so on until it was ready to be released to the world. Remember “think global, start local”.

### Chapter 2 Key Takeaways

- Listen to your audience's pain points and current ways of doing things, but don't ask them for a feature list - your team designs the solution.  
- If you design for everyone it won't work for anyone, so keep it focused.   
- Beauty lies in simplicity - avoid the temptation to add on more features as and when they occur to you - your launch product should focus only on the key offering.  
- Outline all key assumptions that are essential to the success of your business or service. This list will be used to test the feasibility of your product.   
- Launch early and launch often - this will allow for integral iterations to be made in an effective and speedy manner, allowing you to sculpt and craft the perfect product.

## 3. Design Matters

<Quote author="Steve Jobs">Design is not just what it looks like and how it feels. Design is how it works.</Quote>

### Function over Form
   
There is a reason why most people prefer not to eat their fish with its head and scales still on, it looks gross. No matter how fresh, tasty, or nutritious a restaurant's seafood menu is, if the meal still has eyes, you're going next door. It wouldn't matter if this second choice served fish of a lower quality than the first, as long as the food looks appetising. Although apps cannot be said to possess the same aquatic nature as fish (although who can honestly say what the future will bring), they do share a tendency to be either appealing or not by virtue of how they look and 'feel'. As with the restaurant example, if an app had far better features, accessibility, and content, it would still most likely lose customers to a competitor with a slicker design.  
   
Before we delve into the world of design, it would be beneficial to first consider what your team requires from a designer. We know each product is unique and as such no brief will ever be quite the same, however, we have a few tips on what to look out for. Firstly it is important that your designer fully understands your business objectives and is able to create and suggest solutions that are led by these objectives. Being open to and implementing critical feedback is also key. Ego's firmly left by the hat-stand please. They should be aware of when to focus on visuals and when to focus on usability, and can understand when one takes precedence over the other. Having the confidence to voice this understanding will also place checks on any unimportant or low-priority features that might otherwise creep in during the early stages. Lastly, good designers are able to sympathise with other member's roles within your team. Displaying a general knowledge of development will also enable a designer to have a more synchronous relationship with developers, thus ensuring a smoother handover.  
   
With our archetypal designer waiting in the wings then, it is now time to pull the curtains back on the main actor of this chapter, design.  
Everybody can draw on an intuitive notion of what 'design' is as a concept. It is how something looks, feels, smells, tastes and even what emotions it evokes. In the lingua franca of app development, however, there are two terms you should familiarise yourself with, UX and UI (standing for user experience and user interface respectively). These two concepts, though related, are not the same. UI is focused on colours, contrasts, fonts, and generally speaking, making sure content looks good on all devices - it can be understood as a subset of UX. The scope of UX encompasses much more, involving for example, initial research, brainstorming, creation and use of tools such as personas and journey maps, as well as usability reporting. UX is responsible for a product 'feels', whereas UI could be described as how it looks. With these definitions in hand, we can return to our seafood analogy to clarify what we mean. The UI could be likened to how the fish looks on your plate, whereas the UX would include the ambience of the restaurant, the comfort and views provided by your seating, the amiableness of your waiter. As well as how your fishy dinner looked on your plate (UI), it would also involve how it smelled, the texture and taste in your mouth, and even if it produced a nostalgic effect or any other positive (or negative) connotations. You can appreciate that your experience of the fish, its UX, involved a lot more than just how it looked, its UI.  
   
This distinction between UX and UI is an important one to consider when designing your app.  
If you only remember one thing from this chapter, it should be this… Function over fashion!  
In the initial stages of your app's journey, it is imperative that designs should be focused on usability before applying the fine detail of styling. (In our experience, it is generally millennials and gen-z that obsess over how their app looks as opposed to how it works, but take heed anyone can fall into this trap.) Have you ever had the experience of having to write extremely small at the end of a line because you were too focused on making your writing look big and attractive at the beginning? Strange-looking name tags like 'Callum' at conferences attest this blunder. Focus too much at the start on how something looks rather than what it is for and you will end up with something that neither looks good nor functions well - double loss.  
   
When it comes to offering something to potential customers, it can be hard to check your ego, and present a product that you feel looks sub-par. It is tempting to think that aesthetics is the main driver in consumer choice - it is 'a' driver, yes, but not the main one. Think back to your own experiences when you have chosen something solely on how it looked. There would have been times when you wished you had read the reviews, right? Even if alluring visual tactics are used to grab your attention, if the service is bad, the sound quality poor, the connection glitchy….if in any way the product failed to live up to expectations, there won't be any repeat custom.  It must be stressed that we are not advocating that you skip the design, or that you go ahead with sloppy work. The design process is still a must-have, however, it is the overarching UX design that requires attention over and above the smaller (and at this stage less important) element of UI or style.  
   
It is important to get involved and collaborate at this stage of development, even if you don't fancy yourself a 'designer' per se. It's not expected that you take an evening art class or brush up on impressionism (both worthy and interesting pursuits, just not necessary for app design). However, if you are the product owner, the integral vision of the app lies with you and/or your team. Make it a practice to collaborate with the designers throughout the process and be ready to engage testers for the initial prototypes. This will speed up the design and hone in on how best to prepare your app for optimum user experience. These testers preferably should be unbiased strangers, or at the very least, people you trust to give you honest feedback, no mums and aunties allowed!  
 

When designing a digital product, where does it all begin? It begins with sketches and wireframing, the former, we're sure you have no difficulty comprehending.  It is the initial sketch of how a product could look and, although everyone loves tech, there is nothing wrong with using a good old pen and paper for this part of the process. There are programmes available, however, that can be used to the same end. The benefits of using digital software would allow people to create and send designs directly to other team members and clients in real-time, they can also make notes and comments - allowing you to iterate and develop fast. Unlike sketches, which could either be on paper on screen, a wireframe is essentially a digital blueprint for your product. It is a skeleton or frame for each screen in the design, enabling you and your team to review the overall layout before styling (such as imagery, colours, and branding) are applied. It should be created with the mindset of communicating ideas,  and as such should follow the same principles as the previous paragraph - focus on user experience first before the visual polish.   
Sketches and wireframes are great because they are simple and breathe life into the original idea, enabling others to visualise your product. They can be discarded or changed without reluctance due to a lack of attachment, allowing speedier progress. These tools are also useful in promoting genuine feedback, as users will be more likely to give honest opinions when they can see days haven't been spent on what they are criticising.   
 

Collaboration with designers and an emphasis on UX are both crucial during this stage.  
We have worked with a number of teams that for one reason or another (attempts to save money, time etc…) have approached us with existing designs, having either been drawn up by a freelancer or an enthusiastic member of their own team. We are not advocating that you curb this resourcefulness or enthusiasm, just cautioning you against its use in the wrong situations. App designs that were brought to us were usually not thought out as well as they could have been. They tended to focus on the style of the interface rather than how tasks could be completed within the app (user journeys). People tend to fall into this trap when the designs have been created by someone who unconsciously may assume everyone has the same knowledge of their app as they do (remember our warnings against being an ass in chapter 2!).  For example, how could an outsider confidently comprehend the meaning of a company memo that reads “Research Athens”?  The fact that it was referring to the logistics of a possible conference there rather than a myriad of other possibilities (it's history, climate, GDP) is not an obvious one. In the same way then, sketches and wireframes that present only the style of an app, assuming people can navigate through it, will be of no use when testing its usability. The danger does not only apply to in-house designs, but also if you are to hire a freelancer. On many occasions we have come across app designs that contained buttons or other such content that implied the use of functions that simply weren't available. It was clear that the designer did not fully understand the core goals of the product and had taken creative licence (either subconsciously or not) to embellish where they saw fit. Our advice is to ensure sketches and wireframes are kept basic. They should show only the essential aspects of the app that detail a successful user experience and *how* this experience can be achieved. If you are using a freelancer, make sure you are on the same page regarding the design by continuously reviewing and commenting in a back-and-forth manner. It may seem tedious at first, but it will pay off in the long run.  
 
### Prototyping
 
We think wireframes are great, but don't jump the gun just yet and start coding, there is still another stage to go. Creating prototypes. These are simulations of a real product that are used for feedback and testing. Prototypes can be low fidelity (less detailed) or high fidelity (more detailed). Low fidelity prototypes give a more top-down view by showing the overall user-journey. Whereas high fidelity concentrates on particular journeys and logic. There isn't a cut-and-dry choice between the two, however, and in reality they can be anything in between. These are an indispensable tool in any app development process as they allow you to test your product and receive feedback for any required iterations before investing time and money on the build. Our favourite tool for prototyping is 'Figma' as it allows us to manage our design system (more on that later) and UI components in one easily accessible place.   
   
It is a common misunderstanding to think that you need a tangible and functioning app to assess functionality or demand. However this can be just as easily ascertained with a prototype. A good prototype will have a well thought-out design, allowing users to interact with it and give targeted feedback, (otherwise known as 'gold-dust').

When designing your prototype, there are some ground-rules that, if adhered to, will help you in attaining this gold dust for required iterations. Firstly, remember that your prototype should be used to test the core functions of your app. Make it clear to testers that you do not require feedback about styling at this point, just how it functions and how easy it is to use. An easy way to ensure there is no confusion is to stress that the app will not look finished at this point. Perhaps using colourless and/or simple designs will help cement this for the users and prevent them from fixating on it.  
As the design is simple, it should come as no surprise to learn that the prototype will not encompass the full functionality of the app (nor would you want it to as this would serve to undermine the whole purpose of a prototype as well as eat greedily at your precious time). As such, you need to ensure you are deliberate in what tasks you want the interactive prototype to demonstrate. This can be achieved by creating focused prototypes for specific user-journeys (such as navigating to account information, inviting a friend, making a comment etc). A recent example of how Loopspeed put this principle into practice is during our work for  'Peek' - ([joinpeek.io](http://joinpeek.io)). We created separate prototypes driven by the different personas that might interact with the app. For example, as a club owner or a club member. With these persona-specific prototypes in place, we were able to direct users down particular pathways that we wished to review and receive feedback for.  
 
### Design System 

Another useful tool we believe every team should utilise is that of the design system. It may sound imposing, but in reality it is just a pre-built library of design components. These can be used for quick prototyping, design, and development. Having these components to hand allows consistency to reign throughout your design, resulting in the creation of a better quality product. Although time will be required to establish it, with a design system in place, all successive design work will be streamlined and at a much more efficient pace than without one. Let's say a design system is like your favourite seasoning, we're a fan of Cajun fries here at Loopspeed so we'll nominate that. Because we use Cajun seasoning a lot, it's much easier for us to have a jar that has already been pre-mixed. Think how much time has been saved by not having to remember, source and prepare every single herb/spice whenever we wanted to make Cajun fries (trust us, that's a lot). Think of the design components as the individual spices/herbs and the design system as the seasoning. Garlic, Paprika and all the other ingredients that go into this seasoning are great on their own, but they do not give the distinct taste that is widely recognised as Cajun. The same can be said for your design system, it is what distinguishes your product and allows your users to instantly recognise what is in front of them.  
This is something we would advise all teams invest in as early as possible, even for your MVP (minimal viable product), as it will establish smoother working processes from the point of adoption. It will also ensure that any changes that are required further down the line are easy to implement no matter how far into the project.  
   
A design system typically includes:

- Typographic styles  
- Colours and shadows  
- Icon sets  
- UI components  
- Grid layouts  
- Brand guidelines

   
Although not all design systems will be exactly the same, we have included a brief overview for the components that we consider to be indispensable.  

#### Grid layout

This ensures that developers will not use random or inconsistent measurements in their code. It will safeguard against uneven margins or padding, and instead facilitate a visual experience of orderliness and coherency. We typically use multiples of 8px.  
 
#### Typography styles

Choose 1 or 2 font families and use only them throughout the app. It is also important to decide and define common typography styles, for example a style that will always be implemented for 'Heading 1'. We recommend creating a file for fonts that can be managed centrally and with little effort. If you're having trouble finding fonts to harmonise with your brand, check out Google Fonts where you can browse through and adopt a huge selection of fonts for free.  
 
#### Colours

Although there is an option to incorporate a design system that has already been pre-built, such as [https://material.io/design/introduction](https://material.io/design/introduction), sometimes it is desirable to create a unique design system in order to encapsulate your product's brand. If this is your team's strategy, our main tip for choosing your colour palette is to keep it simple. Have faith that it will grow as your brand does.  
   
We'd like to emphasise that having a design system in place will be saving you money, and as such it should be viewed not as a luxury, but a necessity! Your team's design system will be key in preparation for the next step, the build.


## Bonus: Cheatsheet for a Better Looking User Interface

Disclaimer: There are exceptions to every rule.

- Have a strong and clear visual hierarchy   
- Group related elements together.
- Use symmetry.
- If you're using shadows, make them soft. Layer multiple shadows to create a more realistic appearance.  
- Use subtle lines to separate parts of a section.  
- Use plenty of white space. It stops that cluttered look and prevents visual overload. Users are familiar with scrolling and page navigation, so don't feel the need to cram all of your content into one screen.  
- Make sure margins (the space outside of an element) and the padding (the space inside an element) are consistent throughout. (It helps to follow a design system!)  
- Round edges, even if you want the element to look square or rectangular use 1px or 2px radius to reflect the real world. This does not apply to fullscreen content.  
- Great artists steal. So follow common design patterns and make minor adjustments to fit your requirements. In desktop apps people are used to the toolbar being fixed to the top of the window - don't put it at the bottom just to be different.  
- Have one clear action button that takes visual prominence. In Google Docs, the “Share” button is the only blue button in the frame.  
- Keep border-radiuses consistent throughout.

#### Interaction

- Give visual feedback when an element is interacted with (hovered or pressed). For example, a button will transform or change colour when the mouse pointer enters it.   
- Give feedback when something is happening (e.g. show a progress spinner when a file is uploading).

#### Typography

- Use at least 120% line-height for body text. This makes the text more readable and is especially important in longer paragraphs.  
- Reduce the letter spacing (the gap between characters) in headings, and increase it in smaller text to improve legibiity.

#### Colours

- Use an off-white background (e.g. #FEFEFE) and display content inside white cards.   
- Don't use pure black (#000) instead pick a very dark grey (eg. #050505).  
- Subtle gradients can work well but don't over-use them  
- Stick to 1 or 2 colours 
- Have multiple shades of your greys and colour(s). For example: teal0, teal5, teal10, teal20 (Colorbox.IO).  
- Test your colours for accessibility. Don't put light orange text on a white background.
 
### Chapter 3 Key Takeaways

* User Experience (UX) - what the overall experience is for a user.  
* User Interface (UI)  - how the product looks and feels to a user.   
* The initial stage of app design should focus on UX over UI - with usability leading most decisions about features.  
* Make use of sketches, wireframes, and prototypes to test assumptions as well as save time and money.  
* Use a Design System as your 'secret sauce' - pre-prepared and ready to give your product its distinct flavour.

## 4. The Build
   
And now ladies and gentlefolk, the moment you've all been waiting for. The build.  
Having wooed users (and more importantly investors) with your prototype and/or interactive demo - it's time for your developers to flex those fingers and start coding.  
Don't have any fingers to flex?  Speak to Loopspeed!  
If you've already got a great team in place, the next question you should be asking is: What's the most efficient way to work through this project?  
The focus of this chapter is to explain and highlight important terms and practices within the development arena. As well as a few tips and suggestions on the best tools and software available to you and your team. Once fully equipped with this knowledge, you will feel confident in how best to approach the build phase of your project.

### Project Management Methodologies 

<Quote title="Peter Drucker">Until we can manage time, we can manage nothing else</Quote>
   
No truer words were ever spoken, and with that said we would like to introduce you to a few of our favourite time management systems - or if you like sounding fancy, project management methodologies.  
   
There are plenty of project management models out there, however when it comes to software development projects, there are two that stand out. Waterfall and Agile.  
Below is a summary of both.  

#### Waterfall
   
This method advocates a sequential process that flows from one to another. Only when the previous phase has completely finished can work begin on the next. Think of the pools of a waterfall, one will only begin to fill when a higher one is completely full.  
There are six basic steps or phases to this model: **Requirements; Design; Implementation; Verification; Deployment; and Maintenance.**  
   
Let's see how this works in practice with an example. Most like a good party, so we'll go with that.  
   
As any good party planner knows, before any invites can go out, it is necessary to have a firm grasp on what will be needed to make this party a hit. A lot of time is usually spent on the requirements phase as concepts will be discussed and scrutinised. The result of which will help the planner define the specific needs the product, or in our case party, will address. For example, if it's a fund-raising party, methods for donations will be a top requirement. An 80's theme party? Boomboxes and shoulder-pads are now an essential for our planner.  
   
After and only after this phase is complete can our planner move onto the design phase. Here she might draw some rough sketches of what the ball room should look like; tables here, dance-floor there, champagne neutral colours throughout etc. She may also create an approximate timeline for events - 6-6:30pm greet guests; 6:30-8:30pm food and speeches; 8:30-9:30pm competition etc.  
   
After the initial requirements and designs for the party have been completed, our planner begins to implement them. This will see the actuation of the two previous phases. Our planner will contact caterers, venues, costume shops, send out invites. In the world of app development, this is the point where your team will begin to build the actual software from the designs/prototypes.  
   
Next comes the verification, where what has been previously implemented will be tested according to the requirements. The caterers will need to verify they can accommodate the specified number of guests. Costume shop owners will need to agree on a feasible fee. Will that nostalgia company be able to provide 10 boomboxes? For an app, does the software fulfil the requirements for which it was built. After all, what use is a traffic-tracking app, if it is unable to run in real-time?  
   
Deployment comes next, and you guessed it, that means it's party time! Guests are arriving, the champagne is flowing and you can hear the familiar sound of MC Hammer sauntering through the dry ice in the air. Here is where your app has gone live and is available for people to use. Otherwise known as the release. The important thing to note here is that unlike the iterated releases discussed in the previous chapters, a waterfall approach sees this phase commence only once and after a great deal of planning and work has been put into it.  
   
The last phase our planner needs to address before she can go home and put her feet up with a cup of tea and some biscuits is maintenance. This is the stabilisation period where our planner is on hand to ensure the smooth running of the party and collect any feedback or suggestions for her next project. Similarly, here is where your team will be assembling feedback from users, handling complaints, and fixing bugs.  
   
An advantage to using the waterfall method is that it is intuitive and easy to understand. It also ensures projects are fairly easy to manage, resulting in better budget management (music to your investors' ears).  
However, there are some drawbacks too. One being that it isn't very flexible which makes handling unexpected setbacks difficult. What if our planner was informed the day before the party that the patron now wanted a 70's theme rather than 80's? As such this method is better suited to shorter-term projects as it is difficult to capture all the requirements up front for long-term ones.    
 

#### Agile

Flowing on to the next methodology (see what we did there?) brings us to the banks of our second project management approach - Agile.  
   
As the name suggests, this practice allows your team to work in a responsive way. Tasks are completed, or using agile terminology, **value is delivered in small increments**, rather than all together in one big release.  
Feedback from customers and other interested parties are used to create a prioritised list of features and tasks for the development team. This is called the '**product backlog'**. Your team then takes tasks from this backlog to complete and deliver to the customer and collect their feedback - which is in turn fed back into the process. We can see how this process is agile if we compare it to the differences between a gazelle and lion. The lion has a lot of features 'in-built' such as speed, strength, claws, large teeth etc. When it sees its potential meal- the gazelle (or potential audience for product owners), it leaps up, puts all its traits into use, and attempts to capture the gazelle in an all-or-nothing attempt. The gazelle, although not having the plethora of attributes the lion has, does have one thing - it is agile. It is able to change direction quickly when the terrain requires it. The sudden bumpy terrain that might trip the lion up, is quickly evaded by the gazelle, and allows it to sprint on to freedom. This ability to course-correct at each turn will allow your team to easily recover from any setbacks - allowing you to experiment and adapt to changing market conditions and avoid being gobbled up by any predators, that's your competition.  
   
Let's get even more agile…  
   
Due to the rapid learning this method allows, we usually advocate adoption of agile customs for managing most software development projects, especially those in its early stages/ start-ups.   
This is because it helps to avoid time wasted on long, detailed plans as well as preventing excessive attention on details and features that may never be used.  
   
As such, it is worth spending a little more time understanding how you and your team can implement this process. After all, who wouldn't benefit from being a little more agile?  
   
The two main methods of working within an agile framework are **Scrum** and **Kanban.**  
The former has a number of routines or '**ceremonies'** that are employed by a '**Scrum Master'**. Kanban, on the other hand, has fewer of these rituals and is led by an '**Agile Coach'**. Both the scrum master and agile coach are employed to help the product owner and development team build and maintain good working habits.  
   
In terms of scrum, the development team will work in a series of '**sprints**', usually 2 weeks in length. Each sprint is preceded by a meeting attended by the development team, product owner, and scrum master. Here the team will discuss and decide which items from the product backlog are high priority. It is important that items are chosen both for their relevance and for their predicted feasibility. The development team will only pick a certain number of tasks they believe they can commit to completing within the 2 week sprint. The items that have been selected become the '**sprint backlog'** and this is what the team works through for the next fortnight. Although the team is now free to work on tasks individually, each day will begin with a **scrum meeting** or **Daily Stand-up** . The attendees inform their team what they did yesterday, what they're planning on doing today and whether they have any potential roadblocks which might hinder progress. This allows for the smoothest flow of work due to having up-to-date knowledge of the team's progress and the ability to deal with localised issues as they arise.  
The sprint ends with a **sprint review** where any new features or functionality can be demonstrated. There is also a **sprint retrospective** which is a reflective practice aiming to ensure the next sprint is more effective and efficient than the last.  
   
Kanban, although still agile, is a slightly different way of working than Scrum. It's principles involve visualising the work and making sure at each stage tasks are taken up, or **pulled** through the system rather than it being pushed on to people. It too employs a product backlog, however it is not used in the same way. Instead of creating a sprint backlog, a **Kanban board** is used. Essentially this is a table with columns headed by 'to-do', 'work-in-progress', 'done' and usually contains buffer columns to ensure work is always pulled and never pushed on to team members. The Kanban board helps track progress of a strictly limited number of tasks - or **tickets**. When a ticket is completed it will move into the 'done' column and thereby create an empty (or relatively empty) 'work-in-progress' column which is a signal for the previous 'to-do' column to send another ticket through onto the board.  
When the 'to-do' column is empty or runs low, it is a signal for the team to select more items from the product backlog. Unlike scrum which focuses on incremental work, Kanban is a continuous process which seeks to keep the 'work-in-progress' low (each column having a capacity limit) to ensure tickets move across the board and to the user in the shortest possible time. Like scrum, Kanban also has daily stand-up meetings where progress and potential blockers are addressed ensuring the smooth and efficient flow of work.    
   
Depending on your product, your team, and timelines will see you lean towards one or the other of these agile methods. Although both useful, there are a few key differences to be aware of when making the decision.  
A distinguishing aspect between the two is what happens between the product backlog and the user. Whereas Scrum will seek to deliver value to users in small incremental bursts, Kanban practices a continuous workflow. Both, however, seek to get items from the product backlog to the user in the shortest amount of time whilst identifying blockers with their pull-systems. This pull-system works in the form of developers deciding what they can commit to with scrum, unlike Kanban which makes use of buffer-columns and capacity limits.  
Both systems have their merits and it's important to note that each can be flexed accordingly - don't feel you have to be a die-hard scrum user if a particular project or aspect would favour a Kanban approach or vice versa.

{/* **Hammer or screwdriver? - Equipping your team's utility belt**   */}
   
<Quote author="Benjamin Franklin">The best investment is in the tools of one's trade</Quote>
   
One of the most challenging aspects of software development is what apparatus to use to develop your software! This architectural question opens up an array of backend resources to choose from, the abundance of which presents the issue of how to select the right tools for the job.  
Therefore it is imperative that the technology chosen is suitable for the task it was chosen for.  
The choice of cloud computing provider and database services should be guided by what your team needs.  
There are many different combinations available, but when doing your research it's worth keeping a few questions in mind. Such as:  
- How much data will your application use and continue to use as it continues   to grow and become more widely adopted?  - If your product is particularly data-heavy (we're talking millions of gigabytes!) then the range of databases up to the task significantly shrinks. There will also be data storage costs to consider.  
- **How many simultaneous users**? Is this something that habitually undergoes periods of peaks and troughs? In the peak periods will you need to use multiple servers? Would these all be compatible and deliver the same value?  
- **What programming languages will be used?**  - You may want to consider choosing a database that supports the data-type for your application - not all do!  
- **What is your budget?** Usually a big factor in choice, as you will need to think about covering storage costs, licenses, support contracts etc. You may not need to incorporate the last expense if you already have expertise within your team already, however, it is also worth weighing up the cost of them performing administrative and maintenance tasks when they could be adding more value to the project in other ways.  
- **Does your product deal with sensitive data?** If so you need to ensure you choose a service that is capable of maintaining and adhering to strict  data security laws.

Below is a summary of some of the most popular cloud computing services at present, along with their pros and cons.

| Provider | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Amazon Web Services | Industry Leader, Hundreds of Services, Generous Free Tiers. | Overwhelming at first. Not user friendly |
| Firebase (Google) | Easiest to get started with. All the must have services for relatively simple apps | Limited services and database types. Could get expensive |
| Microsoft Azure | Improving quickly, Integrations with the Microsoft ecosystem  | Not very user friendly Can be expensive |
| Google Cloud | x | x |

One last piece of advice from us - ensure you have allocated a decent amount of time and research into picking the right combination of database and server for your product. Once the app is in production, it is very difficult and expensive to migrate - imagine switching half way through icing a cake from buttercream to marzipan…..it would be messy at best, and most likely call to be started again from scratch. What a waste of cake!

Once you've picked the right combo for the job, your next challenge - or more precisely, your development team's challenge is of a more linguistic nature.  
When it comes to coding, it is crucial that your team can name files, functions and data-structures in a clear and concise manner. This will ensure that when another team member picks it up, the meanings can be easily grasped and built upon.  
Think of those notes you write to yourself reminding you to do something, if someone else were to pick them up, there is a good chance it would not be entirely intelligible.  
'E garden', for example, could mean different things to different people - a virtual garden maybe? Or a reference to a 5th garden out of an unknown number perhaps? At worst, it doesn't mean anything at all. How would anyone know it was shorthand (only known to yourself) for 'email the gardener'?  
The same principle applies to code, if names are written in a special cypher known only to an individual coder, it will be very difficult to understand or adapt. Nor will it be repeatable when another picks it up.

### All code is not equal - Under the Hood

<Quote>For every minute spent organising, an hour is earned</Quote>
   
Providing your development team have done their jobs well, the actual code for your project or product is something that you will rarely think about - if at all. This can be both a good and bad thing. Good, in that the code has been written and executed so seamlessly that it is golden in its silence - offering no bugs or glitches to draw your attention. However, not paying any attention to how the code has been written can also be a very bad thing indeed.  
Without any external checks or regulatory standards to keep things organised and efficient, you may be hit with a lot of problems in the not too distant future that you never saw coming.  
Bad code may be written in a rush or on a budget, that is nevertheless undetectable to the untrained eye. Or at least detectable only when users complain that the welcome screen no longer loads, their details have been lost, or connectivity is sketchy.  
   
By implementing some kind of transparency between you and your development team's work, you will hopefully avoid any potential pitfalls.  
Remember, the product is your intellectual property, ergo, so is its code - you have a right (and vested interest) to be a little more familiar with it.  
We know what you're thinking, and the answer is no, you don't have to invest in a beginner's coding course from Udemy. Not everyone will know how to code and that's ok! However, if you wish to ensure your product looks and operates as good from the inside as it does from the outside, we highly recommend having a *coding standards guide* handy with which you can use as a point of reference.  
   
Don't have one? Check out Loopspeeds!\[link\]  
   
Think of it as a novice's checklist for what to look out for. We've all had the experience of inspecting something we didn't know much about through sheer necessity. Ever bought a second-hand car? Assuming you don't already work as a mechanic, we're guessing your specialist knowledge on automobiles and their inner workings leaves something to be desired. Does this mean you would then just purchase a car without going to see it first? It seems sensible that in this case you would either search for or compile a list of things to look for and questions to ask.  
·  	Do the tyres have significant wear to the treads?  
·  	Check underneath the car for any obvious oil leaks!  
·  	Has the cambelt ever been replaced?  
·  	When is the MOT due?  
·  	Check for suspicious noises when turning the engine over!  
The list goes on and we're sure you could add one or two. The point is that even though you're not a mechanic, you are still able to view and inspect a car's suitability for purpose using just a simple guide of what to check. Inspecting code is no different and with our guide we've taken out some of the leg work for you.   
Having someone review the code (it doesn't have to be you!), or encouraging some kind of peer review process on a regular basis will go a long way in maximising your app's performance. It will also make sure any required changes can be applied with precision as well as speed.



<Aside title="What to Look for When Choosing a Developer">

- Significant experience in the specific language/framework that will be used (3+ years).
- Motivated by the outcomes of your business, displayed by taking pride in their work.  
- Effective communicator with strong interpersonal skills.  
- Ability to explain complex concepts to a variety of audiences.  
- Aware of and upfront about weaknesses - Until AI fully dominates app development, you will still have to work with mere mortals. Having an understanding of your developer's weaknesses shouldn't preclude you working with them, but instead provide an opportunity to work with them for the best results.  
- Capable of managing oneself without constant supervision.  
- Works well with others - a team of developers is far better than a lone ranger on many counts. They will be able to produce work faster and with more accuracy.

You may have noticed these are almost all soft skills. Most people can learn to write code, but not everyone can work in a team environment. It is essential that your developer is able to communicate effectively in a manner that all can understand; they need to see your project as a team sport and interact with your team accordingly.

### Optimising Performance

SEO \[Search Engine Optimisation\] appears to be the new buzzword, or buzz-initialism (now we're just showing off) when considering generating business. It is a set of processes and actions taken in order to improve both the quality and quantity of web traffic to your site. It works on increasing visibility for **organic** \[unpaid\] searches. 

Your app's code will, believe it or not, have a big impact on its performance on the device that runs it, as well as search engine rankings. There is a direct relation between the quality of an application's code and its size - and as you are probably aware, the more weight you carry, the slower you go.  
A few tips on how to reduce unnecessary baggage would be to have your developers take a second look at any redundant styling, repeated logic, unoptimised images and any other superfluous elements.  
   
If you're building a web app, use the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to measure performance. It provides an audit of your site in 4 areas; Performance; SEO; Best Practices; and Accessibility. Suggested improvements help guide your team towards making changes in areas that matter, rather than you floundering around in the dark.  
   
As there is no end to the various courses, classes and conferences held in honour of SEO, we will not endeavour to labour it in this guide. However, we have provided a few quick tips that you can use as a sanity check when analysing the performance of your own app on the web.  
 
- Are the URLs search engine friendly?  - For example it is much better to have yourdomain.com/the-page-name, than yourdomain.com/1. This is because Google factors URLs into its ranking algorithm.  
- Are the images optimised for the web?  
- Are you using SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) icons where possible? - These are much smaller than other images and allow you to scale images without losing quality- ideal for responsive web design.   
- Has relevant metadata been added to the site? - E.g. Title, Description, Share Image etc. These will show up when a link is shared, making them doubly useful.  
- Have the correct HTML elements been used?   
- Here is a link for Google's ranking factors which either you or your development team can use for reference. [*https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors*](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors)*\]*
